## Fireworks

Completed in partial fulfillment of Princeton University COS 126.

This program uses a graphics library to offer three modes:
1. An automated firework show that reads inputs.
2. A learning mode where users can match firework colors to the chemicals that produce them.
3. A quiz mode where users can test their knowledge from the learning mode.

This project relies on the `java-introcs` modules found at [https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/).

To run this project, run the following commands:
```
$ javac-introcs FireworkDisplay.java
$ java-introcs FireworkDisplay
```
